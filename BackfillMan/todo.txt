Data-table + Index Code
	Datatable - Row Count in Datatable - Wont work if No of days > 1 - Need to verify each minute too for date = today
	Handle Timeout better- prompt to skip/use partial data

Better Volume, Price Merge

Better Error Handling			
	Make list of Failed Scrips and prompt to retry
		- list out missing bars if less 
		- Can also try both DT and VWAP
	GUI 
		- option to cancel/skip Scrip
		- option to run manually for selected scrips, even EOD
	




	

	
	
	
	
	
	
MultiDay Backfill + Daily Backfill? + Filter out outside market time quotes 
	Handle Hostorical Charts, including for index - Shows text "Historical Chart" instead of "IntraDay Chart" - Will have to switch using menu	
DT - Shift-D also causes separate d keystroke. So if Marketwatch has a scrip starting with D, it gets selected
	check how to avoid it.  Datatable opens correctly though, so no bug
Index - x,y click may fail if index list has  multiple indices and big empty space 
Index - check count after removing useless entries
