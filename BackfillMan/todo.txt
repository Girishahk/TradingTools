Data loading check
	Move to ABBackfill + Return code - esp for Datatable 
	verify scrip name

Datatable
	- Get Date Time column position instead of assuming 2	
Better Error Handling			
	Make list of Failed Scrips and prompt to retry with both VWAP / DT
	GUI 
		- option to cancel/skip Scrip
		- option to run manually for selected scrips, even EOD
MultiDay Backfill + Filter out outside market time quotes 
	Allow Input Date Range for DataTable

	

	
	
	
	



	
Daily Backfill?	
	Handle Hostorical Charts, including for index
		Shows text "Historical Chart" instead of "IntraDay Chart" - Will have to switch using menu


DT - Shift-D also causes separate d keystroke. So if Marketwatch has a scrip starting with D, it gets selected
	check how to avoid it.  Datatable opens correctly though, so no bug
Index - x,y click may fail if index list has  multiple indices and big empty space 
Index - check count after removing useless entries
