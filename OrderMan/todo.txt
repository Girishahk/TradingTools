guessDirection() - test - should be !isEntryLinked()?
After complete - both link and unlink visible
Change L to LIM
Test after entry complete
    - Trail above price allowed after complete - isEntryComplete()
    - Test After Entry - Stop movement - dont guess direction





Cancel Orders - Verify - if open try again and notify if failed     // Once Stop order didnt cancel
Roundoff - Long - Entry Up, Exit Down

Option to change order type for open order
    - SL Order After Trigger - changes to Limit Order - should be editable ( unfilled )
    - Square Off - Market Stop order only if entry is complete - else cancel    // show cancel if not entered else squareoff    
check #IfWinActive / #IfWinExist  to make HK only with AB active
Order Tracker - Do imp stuff more frequently. GUI update can be done once a second ( so 250ms read + Do GUI update once in 4 rounds)
Change to Objects? OrderBook, tracker, submitter, AB etc

























-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Position Conversion option
    - MIS to NRML/CNC + square off some if no margin
Partial Stop orders
    - Show filled size for Entry/Stop
    - Maybe Stop order only entered once filled and stop size modified if Entry Size increases
        - But should always have protective stop for limit orders ( and so also for SL-Limit orders once triggered ) 
    - Even for Limit Entry orders, partial fill affects trailing stop orders
    - Modify Stop Size = Filled size when Trailing 
    - Unfilled -> Need to have seperate protective stop behind Limit price for unfilled orders once order is a LIMIT order 
            ( Limit / SL-Limit after trigger)
        Should be cancelled once size = 0, ie Filled completely
        option to cancel both - remaining qty 
        Trailing Stop size should be always = Filled Size
        Need to differentiate between original stop and Trailing stop ( only when order is unfilled)
            Orignial Stop for unfilled size cannot be moved beyond Entry price
    - Handle cancel orders
    - Square Off - Market Stop order for filled position + cancel rest
Support Adds with Common SL
Target orders + Cancel Stop
    
Bug - MsgBox on top - gets overlapped by updateStatus() on show by Timer
Settings GUI - maybe add tabs for settings of other applications + option to change month/year in scripname
Link Orders
	- how to check Trading symbol against actual scrip - maybe take TradingSymbol as input in ini and use in other places too
	- Can use as filter in read orders - so will get applied to most functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OCO Orders
    - Cancel open order + its SL when other order Entry gets completed
    - Notify + cancel other if a entry order failed
2 part exits
Multiple scrips, Multiple Orders 
    - One Order at a time
    - Keep array of orders and current context
    - Switch context on Scrip/Order change
    - refresh orderbook too on context change + Filter all data for specific scrip - So everything else becomes per scrip    
option to do just 1 order without stop?
Option for Stop orders - SL-Limit?
Pseudo GTC Orders - save orders + option to send all in 1 go + check if already open
thin gui less mode, just get everything as input + unique id -  create order and return uniqueid-orderid pair
