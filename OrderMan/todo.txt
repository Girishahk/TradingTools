Test after entry complete
	 - Trail above price allowed after complete - isEntryComplete()
Test - Price entry, Update button Enabled if linked order is open




Other Entry Order types - SL/SLM - Slippage, Market?  
	Option for Stop orders - SL vs SLM
	Use orderStatusTracker for SL Entry orders, add stop if status complete else notify 
    Option to change order type for open order + handle filled size




























-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cancel Open Orders 
    - both should be open
    - Handle partially Filled orders
    - Square Off - Market Stop order only if entry is complete - else cancel

Partial Stop orders
    - Show filled size for Entry/Stop
    - Maybe Stop order only entered once filled and stop size modified if Entry Size increases
        - But should always have protective stop for limit orders ( and so also for SL-Limit orders once triggered ) 
    - Even for Limit Entry orders, partial fill affects trailing stop orders
    - Modify Stop Size = Filled size when Trailing 
    - Unfilled -> Need to have seperate protective stop behind Limit price for unfilled orders once order is a LIMIT order 
            ( Limit / SL-Limit after trigger)
        Should be cancelled once size = 0, ie Filled completely
        option to cancel both - remaining qty 
        Trailing Stop size should be always = Filled Size
        Need to differentiate between original stop and Trailing stop ( only when order is unfilled)
            Orignial Stop for unfilled size cannot be moved beyond Entry price
    - Square Off - Market Stop order for filled position + cancel rest

Link Orders
	- how to check Trading symbol against actual scrip - maybe take TradingSymbol as input in ini and use in other places too
	- Can use as filter in read orders - so will get applied to most functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
orderbook open - ensure no filters?
Target orders? 2 part exits
Multiple scrips, Multiple Orders 
    - One Order at a time
    - Keep array of orders and current context
    - Switch context on Scrip/Order change
    - refresh orderbook too on context change + Filter all data for specific scrip - So everything else becomes per scrip    
thin gui less mode, just get everything as input + unique id -  create order and return uniqueid-orderid pair
