    
Test
    Trigger Stop + order no saved once stop is created
    Trigger Stop after linking (with pending order) 
    Read code for more use cases




Support Adds with Common SL
    Show Orders in List / Show Position + Stop 
    Position class in Trade + calculate from orders
    Show Position Below in ListView - Qty, Avg Price, Stop
    Entry Area Changes to Add once Entry Triggered

Target orders + OCO Stop 
    - warn if too close as both can trigger  




















-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Partial Stop orders
    - Show filled size for Entry/Stop
    - Maybe Stop order only entered once filled and stop size modified if Entry Size increases
        - But should always have protective stop for limit orders ( and so also for SL-Limit orders once triggered ) 
    - Even for Limit Entry orders, partial fill affects trailing stop orders
    - Modify Stop Size = Filled size when Trailing 
    - Unfilled -> Need to have seperate protective stop behind Limit price for unfilled orders once order is a LIMIT order 
            ( Limit / SL-Limit after trigger)
        Should be cancelled once size = 0, ie Filled completely
        option to cancel both - remaining qty 
        Trailing Stop size should be always = Filled Size
        Need to differentiate between original stop and Trailing stop ( only when order is unfilled)
            Orignial Stop for unfilled size cannot be moved beyond Entry price
    - Handle cancel orders
    - Square Off - Market Stop order for filled position + cancel rest
    - Partial exits, Target
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
check current price and warn if posible bad order based on ordertype 
Ring Alarm / Notify at 15:17 if open orders
    Verify Admin position
    Automatic squareoff at 15:19        
Option to change order type for open order
    - SL Order After Trigger - changes to Limit Order - should be editable ( unfilled )
    - Square Off - Market Stop order only if entry is complete - else cancel    // show cancel if not entered else squareoff
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Position Conversion option
    - MIS to NRML/CNC + square off some if no margin    
Bug - MsgBox on top - gets overlapped by updateStatus() on show by Timer
Settings GUI - maybe add tabs for settings of other applications + option to change month/year in scripname
Link Orders
	- how to check Trading symbol against actual scrip - maybe take TradingSymbol as input in ini and use in other places too
	- Can use as filter in read orders - so will get applied to most functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OCO Orders
    - Cancel open order + its SL when other order Entry gets completed
    - Notify + cancel other if a entry order failed
Multiple scrips, Multiple Orders 
    - One Order at a time
    - Keep array of orders and current context
    - Switch context on Scrip/Order change
    - refresh orderbook too on context change + Filter all data for specific scrip - So everything else becomes per scrip    
option to do just 1 order without stop?
Option for Stop orders - SL-Limit + detect if slipped?
Pseudo GTC Orders - save orders + option to send all in 1 go + check if already open
