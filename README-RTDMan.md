RTDMan
=======

**C++ RTD client for Nest/NOW. Feeds Amibroker.  
Also included is a backfill tool to import VWAP statistics / Nest Plus Data table.**  

  * The tools are based on RTNOW utility by josh1. Read its instructions if needed ( Excel instructions irrelevant ).
    See [RTNOW](http://www.traderji.com/intraday/82733-free-realtime-data-now-nest-odin-trade-tiger-google-yahoo-amibroker-fcharts-ms.html)  
  * Advantages vs RTNOW  
    - No need to use excel. Uses less resources  
    - More accurate data as we pick up every callback from RTD  
  * Disadvantages  
    - Only for NEST / NOW   
    - No GUI. Create one if you can and share under GPLv3. Only need to setup some files and run exe anyway  

#### Instructions        
    1. Setup Amibroker DB (intraday settings) and Nest as explained in josh1 RTNOW instructions  
    2. Copy rtd.format, backfill.format to AmiBroker\Formats  
    3. Read and Setup settings.ini in RTDMan / ABBackFill    
         For 'Now' make sure to change RTDServerProgID value to Now.ScripRTD along with scrip ids / field ids    
    4. Once setup is done, run the exe ( For Backfill, Fill the data in VWAP.txt/DataTable.txt first )  

#### Build
    Build using VC++ 2010 Express. ATL headers and libs taken from Windows Driver kit.
